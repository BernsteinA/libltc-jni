Description: Development files for libltc
 Linear (or Longitudinal) Timecode (LTC) is an encoding of SMPTE timecode data
 as a Manchester-Biphase encoded audio signal. The audio signal is commonly
 recorded on a VTR track or other storage media.
 libltc provides functionality to encode and decode LTC from/to SMPTE or EBU
 timecode, including SMPTE date support.
 .
 This package contains files needed for application development.
